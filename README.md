Machine Learning Notebooks
This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that explore essential concepts in machine learning, based on the content from "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow." Each notebook provides practical implementations and insights into different stages of a machine learning workflow.

Notebooks Overview
Notebook 1: End-to-End Machine Learning Project
This notebook illustrates the entire machine learning pipeline, demonstrating how to take a project from inception to deployment. It covers:

Understanding the problem and defining success metrics.
Data collection, exploration, and preprocessing steps.
Feature engineering techniques and model selection.
Building a machine learning model and validating its performance.
Implementing the model in a production-like environment and ensuring it meets the defined metrics.

Notebook 2: Classification
This notebook focuses on classification techniques, discussing various algorithms and their applications. It includes:

An overview of classification tasks and how they differ from regression tasks.
Implementation of classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests using Scikit-Learn.
Data preprocessing steps like handling missing values and scaling features.
Evaluation of classification models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC curves.

Notebook 3: Training Models
This notebook delves into model training and optimization strategies. It covers:

Best practices for splitting data into training, validation, and test sets.
Hyperparameter tuning techniques, including Grid Search and Randomized Search.
Strategies for handling overfitting and underfitting, such as regularization and early stopping.
Assessing model performance using cross-validation and discussing the importance of model interpretability.
